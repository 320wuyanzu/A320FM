The nacelle is defined as being the set of cowling and system hardware which, fitted on the engine, constitutes a complete flightworthy propulsion system, ready for installation on the airplane. The nacelle consists of the demountable powerplant, the fan cowls, and the thrust reverser cowls. The demountable powerplant consists of the engine and its accessories, the engine air intake, the primary exhaust (including centerbody) and the engine mounts. The Engine Build Up (EBU) consists of the engine and its accessories without the engine air intake, the primary exhaust (including centerbody). The Quick Engine Change (QEC) consists of the engine and its accessories and additional items dependent on selected configuration. The propulsion systems mounted on the right and left wings are interchangeable except for the fan cowl door strake. Each fan cowl incorporates provisions for mounting the strake; the strake is to be installed on the inboard and outboard side of each propulsion system. 2. Description A. Engine  (Ref. AMM D/O 72-00-00-00)  (Ref. Fig. Engine - Schematic SHEET 1)  The engine is a dual-rotor, variable stator, high-bypass ratio turbofan power plant for subsonic service. The design and configuration of the engine are based on obtaining long life high reliability and easy access for line maintenance. It is a modular design which permits the changing of a major assembly without complete dissassembly of the engine. The principal modules of the engine are the low pressure compressor (fan stator and fan rotor), high pressure compressor, turbine frame, combustor chamber, high pressure turbine, low pressure turbine and gearbox. B. Cowling  (Ref. AMM D/O 71-10-00-00)  (Ref. Fig. Nacelle Dimensions SHEET 1)  The cowling assembly consists of : · the air intake cowl · the fan cowl · the thrust reverser cowl · the primary exhaust (primary nozzle and center body). The thrust reverser and the primary exhaust are covered by chapter 78. The hinged thrust reverser and fan cowls are attached to the pylon. The fan cowls are hinged at the upper part by three hinges. They are held open by hold-open rods and provide access to the engine for : · maintenance · rigging · trouble shooting · engine removal/installation C. Mounts  (Ref. AMM D/O 71-20-00-00)  The engine is attached to the pylon by two damage tolerant mounts. The mounts are the main attaching structures (forward and aft). The forward mount comprises four attach bolts that connect the engine directly to the pylon. The aft mount consists of a link and beam system attaching the engine to the pylon. D. Attachment Fittings  (Ref. AMM D/O 71-40-00-00)  The attachment fittings and support brackets ensure the attachment on the engine of : · components · ducts · pipes · electrical cables The attachment fittings and support brackets are attached on : · the engine core · the fan case · the accessories · the accessory gearbox. E. Fire Protection  (Ref. AMM D/O 26-00-00-00)  Firewalls and fire seals provide segregation and fire protection between the engine compartments (fan and core compartments). The fire seals separate the space within the engine into compartments. This means of isolation limits propagation, should a fire occur. The pylon floor forms the upper firewall of both the fan and core compartments. F. Electrical Harness  (Ref. AMM D/O 71-50-00-00)  The engine electrical harness serves for connection with the electrical components mounted in the nacelle pylon. The engine electrical harness : (1) distributes the power required by the aircraft electrical system, (2) transmits signals for : · nacelle sub-systems · engine control · monitoring functions. G. Engine Drains  (Ref. AMM D/O 71-70-00-00)  The drain and vent system consists of lines collecting and carrying waste fluids and vapors overboard. This system drains accessories and engine components.
