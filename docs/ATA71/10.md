1. General (Ref. Fig. Air Intake Cowl (1100KM1, 1100KM2) SHEET 1)  (Ref. Fig. Air Intake Assembly - Details SHEET 1)  The engine air intake cowl structure is an interchangeable aerodynamically faired assembly. It is mounted to the forward face of the engine fan case A1 flange. The assembly is composed of : · an inner and outer barrel · a nose lip · a forward and an aft bulkhead. The assembly also includes installation of : · the anti-icing ducting · the engine control unit cooling inlet and exhaust · the interphone/ground jack · the T2 sensor · hoisting provisions · pip pin receptacles for the intake cover. 2. Description A. Air Intake Cowl Configuration (Ref. Fig. Air Intake Cowl (1100KM1, 1100KM2) SHEET 1)  (Ref. Fig. Air Intake Assembly - Details SHEET 1)  (Ref. Fig. Air Intake Cowl Cross Section SHEET 1)  The outer barrel of the air intake cowl is made of two panels of composite construction and an aluminium access panel. The outer barrel assembly features include a pressure relief door to protect the inlet cowl structure against a burst of the anti-ice supply line. This pressure relief door is located on the access panel which includes the anti-ice air exhaust duct. The outer barrel assembly also includes an inlet scoop which provides cooling air to the Engine Control Unit (ECU) and two inlet scoops which provide air for ventilating the fan compartment. All of these inlet scoops are located on the outer barrel and penetrate the inlet cowl aft bulkhead which forms the forward part of fan compartment fire barrier. Other features on the outer barrel assembly include a phone jack, hoisting provisions, and pip pins for the inlet cowl cover, and fan cowl door alignment fittings. The fan cowl alignment fittings are controlled on the inlet cowl aft bulkhead outer ring and align/position the fan cowl doors to ensure proper gaps are maintained between the inlet cowl, fan cowl, and thrust reverser. The composite skin of the inlet cowl outer barrel incorporates a lightning protection system consisting of an expanded copper screen (ECS) material. This material enables the inlet cowl to satisfy Zone 1A lightening strike requirements. The inner barrel consists of three acoustically treated structural bonded panels, which are assembled with mechanical fasteners, and attached to an engine attach ring. The aft bulkhead and nose lip assembly are connected to the outer barrel and the inner barrel. B. Air Intake Cowl Anti-Icing (Ref. Fig. Cowl Swirl Anti-Ice System SHEET 1)  (Ref. Fig. Access Panels on Air Intake Cowl SHEET 1)  The nose lip assembly consists of an outer lip skin and bulkhead. The lip skin and bulkhead comprise the anti-icing "D" duct. A swirl nozzle is mounted in the "D" duct for distribution of the anti-icing air into the "D" duct. A supply tube supplies the anti-icing air to the swirl nozzle. The supply tube penetrates the "D" duct bulkhead. A slip joint is provided at the "D" duct bulkhead to allow for duct thermal expansion. Engine bleed air comes into the nose lip cavity through the swirl nozzle. The air exits into the air intake cowl cavity aft of the "D" duct bulkhead : the air passes through openings in the "D" duct bulkhead inner cap. The air exhausts overboard through a flush exit duct in the outer barrel. A deflector is provided at the "D" duct exit. It prevents direct anti-icing air impingement on the forward portion of the acoustic inner barrel panels. The system is capable of operation under all ground and flight conditions. C. Air Intake Cowl Access There are a total of five access and inspection locations in the air intake cowl. Three inspection panels are located on the aft bulkhead. (Ref. Fig. Access Panels on Air Intake Cowl SHEET 1)  The access panel is located on the outer barrel and contains the anti-ice exhaust exit and pressure relief door. The fifth access location is on the forward bulkhead. This panel provides access to the anti-ice supply duct. The swirl nozzle is accessible after removing the dedicated anti-ice exhaust duct. D. Air Intake Cowl Acoustic Treatment (Ref. Fig. Air Intake Cowl Cross Section SHEET 1)  The inner barrel is a bonded aluminum honeycomb structure. E. Air Intake Cowl Structure The majority of the internal pressure loads and external air loads are taken in hoop tension through the inner barrel skins. Longitudinal and transverse loads due to the inlet cowl structure's own inertia as well as any internal or external loads not taken in hoop tension, are distributed into the fan case forward flange through a bolted joint. Thirty-six identical attachment bolts and one alignment pin are provided. Special spacers intalled with each attachment bolt help in absorbing engine blade out loads. The acoustic panels are structural and, as such, carry air intake cowl loads. The intake cowl aft bulkhead forms a land for the fan cowl leading edge.
