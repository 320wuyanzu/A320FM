aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 00 概述</h1> <ol><li>General (Ref. Fig. Nacelle SHEET 1)  Each engine is housed in a nacelle suspended from a pylon attached to the wing lower surface. The nacelle is defined as being the set of cowling and system hardware which, fitted on the engine, constitutes a complete flightworthy propulsion system, ready for installation on the airplane. The nacelle consists of the demountable powerplant, the fan cowls, and the thrust reverser cowls. The demountable powerplant consists of the engine and its accessories, the engine air intake, the primary exhaust (including centerbody) and the engine mounts. The Engine Build Up (EBU) consists of the engine and its accessories without the engine air intake, the primary exhaust (including centerbody). The Quick Engine Change (QEC) consists of the engine and its accessories and additional items dependent on selected configuration. The propulsion systems mounted on the right and left wings are interchangeable except for the fan cowl door strake. Each fan cowl incorporates provisions for mounting the strake; the strake is to be installed on the inboard and outboard side of each propulsion system. 2. Description A. Engine  (Ref. AMM D/O 72-00-00-00)  (Ref. Fig. Engine - Schematic SHEET 1)  The engine is a dual-rotor, variable stator, high-bypass ratio turbofan power plant for subsonic service. The design and configuration of the engine are based on obtaining long life high reliability and easy access for line maintenance. It is a modular design which permits the changing of a major assembly without complete dissassembly of the engine. The principal modules of the engine are the low pressure compressor (fan stator and fan rotor), high pressure compressor, turbine frame, combustor chamber, high pressure turbine, low pressure turbine and gearbox. B. Cowling  (Ref. AMM D/O 71-10-00-00)  (Ref. Fig. Nacelle Dimensions SHEET 1)  The cowling assembly consists of : · the air intake cowl · the fan cowl · the thrust reverser cowl · the primary exhaust (primary nozzle and center body). The thrust reverser and the primary exhaust are covered by chapter 78. The hinged thrust reverser and fan cowls are attached to the pylon. The fan cowls are hinged at the upper part by three hinges. They are held open by hold-open rods and provide access to the engine for : · maintenance · rigging · trouble shooting · engine removal/installation C. Mounts  (Ref. AMM D/O 71-20-00-00)  The engine is attached to the pylon by two damage tolerant mounts. The mounts are the main attaching structures (forward and aft). The forward mount comprises four attach bolts that connect the engine directly to the pylon. The aft mount consists of a link and beam system attaching the engine to the pylon. D. Attachment Fittings  (Ref. AMM D/O 71-40-00-00)  The attachment fittings and support brackets ensure the attachment on the engine of : · components · ducts · pipes · electrical cables The attachment fittings and support brackets are attached on : · the engine core · the fan case · the accessories · the accessory gearbox. E. Fire Protection  (Ref. AMM D/O 26-00-00-00)  Firewalls and fire seals provide segregation and fire protection between the engine compartments (fan and core compartments). The fire seals separate the space within the engine into compartments. This means of isolation limits propagation, should a fire occur. The pylon floor forms the upper firewall of both the fan and core compartments. F. Electrical Harness  (Ref. AMM D/O 71-50-00-00)  The engine electrical harness serves for connection with the electrical components mounted in the nacelle pylon. The engine electrical harness : (1) distributes the power required by the aircraft electrical system, (2) transmits signals for : · nacelle sub-systems · engine control · monitoring functions. G. Engine Drains  (Ref. AMM D/O 71-70-00-00)  The drain and vent system consists of lines collecting and carrying waste fluids and vapors overboard. This system drains accessories and engine components. H. Lightning Protection and Grounding (Ref. Fig. Lightning Zones SHEET 1)  The composite outer skins of the inlet cowl and fan cowl incorporate a lightning protection system (Ref. 71-11-00 and 71-13-00). Mechanical attachment and fittings conduct the current into the pylon/engine structure. J. HIRF and EMI The inlet cowl and fan cowl composite graphite outer skins incorporate an Expanded Copper Screen (ECS) which increases the electromagnetic compatibility of the structure. The continuous fan cowl door to pylon rub strip is made of corrosion resistant steel materials which closes the electromagnetic aperture of this joint. The fan compartment ventilation scoops are made of 321 steel material and the fan compartment ventilation exhaust located in the lower right hand fan cowl door features an Inconel 625 grid which screens electromagnetic signals. K. Ventilation (Ref. 75-00-00) The engine fan and core compartments are ventilated to maintain equipment, and fluid, temperatures at suitable levels. Ventilation of the compartments also contributes to fire prevention by eliminating the buildup of flammable fluids, or vapors, to dangerous levels. 1.

The drain and vent system consists of lines collecting and carrying waste fluids and vapor overboard from the engine and nacelle accessories. Drains are provided to carry fluids from any point where lines and accessories may leak and where fluids may accumulate in a cavity. In addition, some drain lines serve as vents to carry air and vapor from the engine and accessory cavities.</p> <p>(Ref. Fig. Drain and Vent Schematic SHEET 1)  (Ref. Fig. Drain System SHEET 1)  The drain and vent system is divided into two parts; one which retains drained fluids until expelled during flight (reservoir), and one which discharges fluid directly overboard through the drain mast located in the fan compartment. The reservoir module is mounted on the transfer gearbox. The manifold module is also attached to the transfer gearbox and supports the drain mast, which protrudes through the fan cowl doors into the airstream.   Each accessory pad seal has a separate drain cavity in the reservoir module in which leakage is contained. Manual drain valves in the bottom of these reservoirs aid in tracing the source of excess leakage. Each reservoir is identified with the accessory seal drain to which it is connected. These individual reservoirs overflow into the fuel holding tank or an hydraulic fluid/oil holding tank. This overflow is contained in the holding tank until the aircraft reaches an airspeed of 200 Knots. A pressure valve, which is part of the manifold module assembly, then admits ram air to pressurize the holding tanks and discharge any accumulated fluid overboard through the drain mast.   The fluids that are discharged directly overboard are from: · the oil tank scupper · the forward sump · the fan case · the oil/fuel heat exchanger · the VBV · the VSV · the TCC · the aft sump · the fuel shroud pipe. For the shroud pipe no leakage is permissible, a separate drain line enables a clear leakage identification. · the 6 o'clock fire bulkhead. · FRV   Based on two hour total flight profile (start, taxi, takeoff, cruise, descent, taxi), the individual reservoir volumes are twice the accumulated liquid level based on acceptable leakage rates. The volumes provide sufficient containment margin to discriminate between excessive and acceptable leakage rates. Fuel, Oil or hydraulic leakage limits are given in 71-00-00 P.Block 501.</p> <p>Component Location (Ref. Fig. Drain System SHEET 1)  (Ref. Fig. General Location SHEET 1)  A.
